# GOWALL

## Description

GoWall is a simple tool I created to set the wallpaper on my Mac. It's written in Go and uses the `osascript` command to set the wallpaper.

## Usage

To use GoWall, simply run the following command:

```bash
git clone 
cd /path/to/gowall
chmod +x set_wallpaper.scpt
go run main.go
```

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add support for Windows
- [ ] Add support for Linux
- [ ] Add support for setting the wallpaper to a specific image
- [ ] Add support for setting the wallpaper to a random image
